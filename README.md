# EmoTone Analyzer

## Overview
EmoTone Analyzer is an advanced emotion detection system that utilizes k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze and predict the emotional tone of human audio signals. This project showcases the application of machine learning algorithms on audio data from the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song.

## Features
- **Emotion Prediction**: Classifies audio signals into positive or negative emotional tones.
- **Mel Spectrogram & Chromagram Analysis**: Uses advanced audio processing techniques for feature extraction.
- **Optimized k-NN Classifier**: Implements k-NN with cross-validation to determine the optimal k value.
- **PCA for Dimensionality Reduction**: Enhances performance and reduces computational load.

## Installation
To set up the EmoTone Analyzer, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kodychik/EmoToneAnalysis
cd EmoTone

install requirements as given in ipynb file.
